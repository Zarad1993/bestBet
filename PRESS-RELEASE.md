## APP TITLE TBD ##
> **Find restaurants around you based on the criteria you care most about _right now._**

## Summary ##
  > A mobile app that uses real-time data crunching to suggest nearby restaurants you’re likely to enjoy based on the recent experiences of other users with similar preferences.

## Problem ##
  > If you want to find a restaurant that meets a specific criterion (i.e. not too crowded, not too loud, quick service), you have to google or yelp restaurants in your area with those keywords, then read through a deluge of reviews, trying to again find those keywords in each review, and manually deduce whether a restaurant is likely to meet or fail that criterion.

**This process is a) a huge hassle and b) totally ineffective. It’s close to guesswork on your part.**


## Solution ##
  > Our app allows users to indicate their preferences and rate restaurants based on those preferences. The database tracks (in real time) the aggregated scores based on user preferences.

Example: *(73% of users who care about loudness found this restaurant too loud).*

**Thus, when searching a map for restaurants around me, I can see how every restaurant scores on the specific criteria I care about.**
